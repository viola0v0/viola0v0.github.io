Welcome to our website.It aimed to analyze different crime types from 2003 to 2017 in San Francisco.We focus on the relationship between drunk driving and vehicle theft. Our platform provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of these specific crimes on Sundays over this time period. By examining the data, users can gain a comprehensive understanding of the occurrence and frequency of drunk driving incidents and vehicle thefts in the city. This information can be utilized by the people to develop strategies and initiatives aimed at reducing these crimes and ensuring a safer environment for all residents and visitors.

This topographic area map clearly shows the total number of vehicle theft cases on Sundays in various areas of Los Angeles between 2003 and 2017.As you can see, the colors from dark to light reflect the increase in the number of cases, with lighter colors representing more cases in the area and darker colors representing fewer cases in the area. The darkest city, Tenderloin, had only 356 vehicle thefts, while the lightest city, INGLESIDE, had 2,846.
There are also corresponding differences in other different regions. For example, Southern and central, which are closer in color, have 1,566 and 1,506 cases respectively. Northern has 2,001 cases. park and richmond have 1328 and 1366 respectively. Mission has 2,400 cases. There were 2,322 cases in Bayview and 19,443 cases in Taraval. Overall, there are significantly fewer cases in the north than in the south. Therefore, in later police arrangements, we need to focus on the south

This chart clearly shows the proportion of each crime type occurring in each hour on Sunday. Judging from the overall trend, the number of cases peaked at 0 o'clock, then gradually decreased, reaching the lowest at 4 o'clock, and then began to rise. It reached a small peak at 7 o'clock-8 o'clock and then gradually decreased slowly, but continued to rise around 11 o'clock. High until it reaches the peak again at 23:00-24:00.

Mapping this to our daily life, it is not difficult to find that there will be more cases when people get up in the morning and go out outdoors, and when people start their morning busyness, the cases begin to decrease until after get off work for some specific cases, such as prostitution. Judging from the time, both drunk driving and vehicle theft occur at night, and while the number of vehicle theft cases increases, drunk driving also gradually increases. So we might as well assume that people drink heavily, commit vehicle theft and drive away. Therefore, it is speculated that the police may pay more attention to areas where bars gather and increase cameras appropriately, which may help reduce incidents.
